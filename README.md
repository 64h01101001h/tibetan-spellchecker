===

This repository provides resources to build Tibetan spellcheckers, as well as some compiled ones.

This is work in progress.

You might be interested in the different [documents](doc/) before starting, and you can explore the [syllables](syllables) directory, containing a spellchecker at syllable level, and the corresponding hunspell files.
