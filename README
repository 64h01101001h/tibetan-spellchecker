                        Tibetan Spell-cheking files
*******************************************************************************

This repository provides files for constituting a tibetan spell-checker with the
hunspell format.


Features
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The syllables present in the files are those present in the 
Bod rgya tshik mdzod chen mo dictionnary, excepting the syllable not conform
to standard tibetan grammar rules, so Sanskrit translitteration is not included.

Tibetan Grammar rules have been taken mainly from:
 - /Manuel de Tibétain Standard/ by Nicolas Tournadre
 - /Le clair mirroir/ by Kesang Gyurmé, translation of Nicolas Tournadre
 - /The Illuminator Dictionnary/ by Tony Duff
 - http://www.thlib.org/reference/transliteration/tibstacks.php
 - An Introduction to the Grammar of the Tibetan Language (Chandra Das)
   available at http://archive.org/details/grammaroftibetan00dass

The bo_CN.dic file is in alphabetical order (the order used is the one presented
in /The Illuminator Dictionnary/), and could be used as a reference.


Limitations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some very common words of sanskrit translitterations are not present but might
be in the near future, words like པ་དྨ་ or ཀརྨ་.

Only single syllables are considered, not words with multiple syllables. This
could be added, and might be soon, but will only work if syllables of the same
word are separated by non-breaking tsheg (U0F0C) instead of tsheg (U0F0B), which
is something I have never seen anyone use.


Responsible Persons
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following people have contributed to this package:

Xavier Faure             <suizokukan@orange.fr>
Elie Roux                <elie.roux@telecom-bretagne.eu>

The main work (syllable validation against grammar rules and alphabetical order)
have been done by Xavier Faure, and this packaging by Elie Roux.

The bo.dic file is automatically generated by dchar 
<https://github.com/suizokukan/dchars>.
