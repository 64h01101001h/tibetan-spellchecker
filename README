                        Tibetan Spell-cheking files
*******************************************************************************

This repository provides files for constituting a tibetan spell-checker with the
hunspell format.


Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The syllables present in the files are those present in the 
Bod rgya tshik mdzod chen mo dictionnary, excepting the syllable not conform
to standard tibetan grammar rules, so Sanskrit translitteration is not included.

Tibetan Grammar rules have been taken mainly from:
 - "Manuel de Tibétain Standard" by Nicolas Tournadre
 - "Le clair mirroir" by Kesang Gyurmé, translation of Nicolas Tournadre
 - "The Illuminator Dictionnary" by Tony Duff
 - http://www.thlib.org/reference/transliteration/tibstacks.php
 - "An Introduction to the Grammar of the Tibetan Language" by Chandra Das
   available at http://archive.org/details/grammaroftibetan00dass

The bo.dic file is in alphabetical order (the order used is the one presented
here: http://developer.mimer.com/collations/tibetan/Chilton_slides.pdf), and
could be used as a reference.


Limitations and Bugs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some very common words of sanskrit translitterations are not present but might
be in the near future, words like པ་དྨ་ or ཀརྨ་.

Only single syllables are considered, not words with multiple syllables. This
could be added, and might be soon, but will only work if syllables of the same
word are separated by non-breaking tsheg (U0F0C) instead of tsheg (U0F0B), which
is something I have never seen anyone use.

If you find a bug, please file a bugreport at 
https://github.com/eroux/tibetan-spellchecker/issues

Using
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under Windows:
 - for Firefox, go in the firefox/ directory and run make, this will
     build a .xpi extension that you can add to you firefox. The most simple
     way of getting it (without compiling) is on 
     https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/tibetan-spellchecker/
 - for LibreOffice (should work for OpenOffice too), go in the lo directory
     and run make, it will build a .oxt extension you can install.
 - for Adobe Indesign (>= CS5.5), see the instructions exposed at
     http://blog.napsys.com/2012/11/adding-hyphenation-and-spelling.html

Under Linux:
 - if you are under debian or ubuntu, the package is going to be packaged soon,
     in the meantime, you can create a .deb file by running make in the debian/
     directory. Make sure you have dpkg-dev, debhelper and
     dictionaries-common-dev installed. This will make the spellchecker
     available for Firefox, LibreOffice and all applications.
 - if you are not, then please file a bugreport against your distribution
     asking for it to package tibetan-spellchecker. The team is ready
     to help for this. In the meantime you can use the Firefox and LibreOffice
     extensions (see above, "Under Windows").

Under MacOSX: (not tested)
 Copy the .aff and .dic files in the /Library/Spelling directory.
 Reboot the computer, this way the Huspell files will be loaded when the
 system initializes. This should make the dictionary available for all
 applications (I hope).


Prerequisites
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The files have been tested with hunspell 1.3.2, but should work with previous
versions.

Firefox has been tested only with version >=21.
